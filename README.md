## Details
### Game Description
All That Glitters is Gold (ATGIG) is a third-person Action game which combines high-density Horde combat, Looter-shooter attributes, and gunplay to craft a lite experience that aspires to whet the "Power-Fantasy" appetite.
### Responsibilities
I am solo-developing All That Glitters is Gold. As such, I am responsible for:
* Player abilities (movement, evasion, melee & sprinting)
* Player systems (Slope Traversal and Anti-camera clipping)
* Weapon attributes (type, damage, rate of fire, etc.)
* Weapon augmentations (rarity, cheats)
* Weapon saving
* Enemy attack types (charge, pounce, jump, etc.)
* Gametypes (Viricide)
* Out-of-gameplay systems (Inventory Management, Weapon Kiosk)

Bulleted below are detailed accounts of ATGIG's notable pursuits, accompanied by visuals and organized by category.
