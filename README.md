The objective of this game is to reach the end of the level. There is a large cylinder object that acts
as the goal line; approaching it at close-range will reload the level. Set between you and this goal are four
combat encounters of escalating enemy density. Clearing these encounters is not required to win, but engagement
is encouraged. 

2.) Your Player-character  
You assume the avatar of a capsule-character. Your camera sits above what would be their right shoulder. 
This character can move and look in any direction you wish, But there is a limit to how far up or down the 
character can look. Your character has a moderate movement speed, and they cannot jump. This character 
starts with 500 Health and 550 Shield. So long as you have Shield strengh remaining, you cannot take Health 
damage. If Shield is ever depleted, there is a seven-second delay before it begins to regenerate itself. 
Health, however, cannot regenerate itself. If Health ever reaches zero, you will be defeated, and pressing 
'F' will reload the level. You have access to an Inventory with no limit to its capacity, though if it becomes
too dense with items, hold 'X' on your current item to dismantle it.  

3.) Enemy Combatants  
Enemies in this game are also capsule-characters, denoted by both size and color. There are five attack types that
you will experience: 

Charge - Enemies that prefer to ram into you directly for high damage. Successful contact will daze them for two
seconds before attempting to charge again. Charge enemies will physically knock you back a great distance. They are
magenta-colored small capsules.
  
Melee - Enemies that slowly move towards you to inflict constant damage. Successful contact will physically
knock you back a short distance. They are red-colored small capsules.

Range - Enemies that stand a great distance away to lob low-damage projectiles at you. The projectiles are fast-
moving, but can be dodged easily if you are attentive. They are orange-colored small capsules.

Pounce - Enemies that deftly skip towards you from a great distance away. Successful contact will pause their next
attack for one second before attempting again. This attack shares the same knockback strength as the Charge attack.
They are large capsules with a metallic orange color.

Jump - Enemies that commit to a large leap in your direction. Being too close to this enemy as they are airborne
coverts the jump into a guided attack, scoring a guaranteed hit on you. Idling for one second while within range of
you will force them to jump. This attack shares the same knockback strength as the Pounce and Charge attacks.
They are large capsules with a metallic red color.

Each combat encounter will generate a combination of enemies with these attack types. Once they spawn, they never
stop seeking you out.

4.) Game Difficulty  
Every successful level clear will raise the game's difficulty, of which there are five. Every new game starts
at Difficulty 1. Enemies gain more health and deal more damage, up to 100% more health and 50% more damage
at Difficulty 5. You receive more health and shield, up to 100% additional health and shield at Difficulty 5. 
Weapons starting at Rarity 2 receive a 20% base damage increase, up to 50% at Rarity 5. Level clears at 
Difficulty 5 do not increase difficulty.

5.) Weapons & RNG  

There are seven firearm types available to you:  
-Pistol  
-Submachine Gun  
-Rifles (Single - fires once, Full - fires automatic, Semi - fires three times in succession)  
-Shotgun  
-Machine Gun  

There are five rarities each firearm can appear with:  
-Usual (Common)  
-Sought (Uncommon)  
-Coveted (Rare)  
-Treasured (Superior)  
-Fated (High-End/Exotic)  

This game's Core system revolves around a firearm's augmentation through what are known as Cheats. There are two
types:  
Statistical - Cheats that alter a firearm's performance through changing ammo counts, reload speeds and ranges.  
Functional - Cheats that require a condition to be met to receive a particular benefit.  
Usual-rarity Weapons do not spawn with Functional Cheats. Sought and Coveted-rarity Weapons spawn with one 
random Functional Cheat. Treasured and Fated-rarity Weapons spawn with two random Functional Cheats. Functional 
Cheats rolled on Fated-rarity Weapons are significantly more powerful than their standard behaviors, within reason.
Exotic-rairty Weapons are supreme armaments, equipped with two Functional Cheats; one that is unique to the Weapon type, and
another that is selected from the original pool of ten.
