1.) Experience
There are two modes available for play: 
Campaign - A linear 2-mission string involving travel to a level's end. Between your start and end goal are 
enemy encounters of varying densities. Clearing the encounters are not required, but engagement is encouraged. 

Viricide - A small experience that culminates in a boss encounter with a simple damage mechanic. Successful 
Viricide completions rewards Weapons, with more being awarded on higher difficulties. One campaign clear is required to unlock Viricide.

2.) Your Player-character
You assume the avatar of a capsule-character. This character can move and look in any direction you wish, though
the angle of Vertical view is clamped to not be too high or low. This character starts with 500 Health and 550 
Shield. You cannot take Health damage while your Shield is active, though if it ever depletes, there is a seven-
second delay before it begins to regenerate. Health cannot regenerate itself. You are defeated when your 
Health reaches zero, and pressing 'F' will reload the level. You have access to an Inventory with no capacity 
limit, and holding 'X' on your current item will destroy it. For self-defense, press 'F' to commit a melee attack 
when in range of an enemy. 

3.) Enemy Combatants
Enemies in this game are also capsule-characters, denoted by both size and color. There are five attack types that
you will encounter: 

Charge - Enemies that prefer to ram into you directly for high damage. Successful contact will daze them for two
seconds before attempting to charge again. They are magenta-colored small capsules.
  
Melee - Enemies that slowly move towards you to inflict constant damage. Successful contact will physically
knock you back a short distance. They are red-colored small capsules.

Range - Enemies that stand a great distance away to fire low-damage projectiles at you. The projectiles are fast-
moving, but are easily dodged. They are orange-colored small capsules.

Pounce - Enemies that deftly skip towards you from a great distance away. Successful contact will pause their next
attack for one second before attempting again. They are large capsules with a metallic orange color.

Jump - Enemies that commit a large leap in your direction. Being too close to this enemy as they are airborne
coverts the jump into a guided attack, scoring a guaranteed hit on you. Idling for one second while within range of
you will force them to jump. They are large capsules with a metallic red color.

Each combat encounter will generate a combination of enemies with these attack types. Once they spawn, they never
stop seeking you out.

4.) Game Difficulty
There are five total difficulties, and the first four are immediately available for play. Be advised: 
	Enemies gain more Health and deal more damage, up to 100% more Health and 50% more damage at Difficulty 5. 
	You receive more Health and Shield, up to 100% additional Health and Shield at Difficulty 5. 
	Weapons starting from Rarity 2 receive a 20% base damage increase, up to 50% at Rarity 5. 
	Drop rates for Loot and Lucent begin to decrease, receiving a 50% reduction in rate by Difficulty 5.
Completing the Campaign for the first time will unlock Difficulty 5 for play. 

5.) Weapons & RNG
There are seven firearm types available to you:
-Pistol 
-Submachine Gun (SMG)
-Rifles (Single - fires once, Full - fires automatic, Semi - fires three times in succession)
-Shotgun 
-Machine Gun 

There are five rarities each firearm can appear with:
-Usual (Common; Rarity 1)
-Sought (Uncommon; Rarity 2)
-Coveted (Rare; Rarity 3)
-Treasured (Superior/Legendary; Rarity 4)
-Fated (High-End/Exotic; Rarity 5)

This game's Core system revolves around a Weapon's augmentation through what are known as Cheats. There are two
types:
Statistical - Cheats that alter a Weapon's performance through manipulating ammo counts, reload speeds and ranges.
Functional - Cheats that require a condition to be met to receive a particular benefit.
Rarity 1 Weapons do not spawn with Functional Cheats. Rarity 2 and 3 Weapons spawn with one 
random Functional Cheat. Rarity 4 and 5 Weapons spawn with two random Functional Cheats. Functional 
Cheats rolled on Rarity 5 Weapons are significantly more powerful than their standard behaviors, within reason.
