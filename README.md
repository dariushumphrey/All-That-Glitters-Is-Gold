## Experience 

There are two modes available for play and two features available for use: 

	Campaign - A linear 2-mission string involving travel to a level's end. Between your start and end goal are 
	enemy encounters of varying densities. Clearing the encounters are not required, but engagement is encouraged. 

	Viricide - A small experience that culminates in a boss encounter with a simple damage mechanic. Successful 
	Viricide completions rewards Weapons, with more being awarded on higher difficulties. One campaign clear is required to unlock Viricide.

	Inventory - A space that allows you to look over your current Weapons and study their stats and rolled Cheats. This page offers more detailed 
	explanations of Cheats rolled, and allows Weapons to be sold at 80% of their worth instead of being destroyed.

	Requisitions - A space that offers six Weapons at random to be purchased for Lucent. This Kiosk changes its selection on every return visit to
	the Main Menu, and Weapons' rarities begin between Rarity 1 and 3, upgrading to Rarity 4 and 5 when Viricide is completed for the first time.  

## Your Player-character

You assume the avatar of a capsule-character. This character can move and look in any direction you wish. 
This character starts with 500 Health and 550 Shield. Your shield will take damage before your Health does, though if it ever depletes, there is 
a seven-second delay before it begins to regenerate. 

	Pressing 'F' will reload the level when you are defeated. 
 	You have access to an Inventory with no capacity limit, and holding 'X' on your current item will destroy it. 
  	Press 'F' to commit a melee attack when an 'X' reticle appears on an enemy. 
   	Holding 'G' will prepare a grenade to be thrown, and letting go will throw it. 
	To sprint, hold the 'Shift' key to increase your speed, but know that Weapons are unusable during sprint. 
 	To evade danger, press the 'Space' key with directional input. 

## Enemy combatants

Enemies in this game are also capsule-characters, denoted by both size and color. Combatants are all black with colored grafts that denote 
attack style: 

	Charge - Enemies that prefer to ram into you directly for high damage. Their grafts are magenta colored.  
	Melee - Enemies that prepare an attack after a short delay when in range of you. Their grafts are black, though in a Horde, they are red.
	Range - Enemies that stand a great distance away to fire low-damage projectiles at you. Their grafts are orange colored.
	Pounce - Enemies that deftly skip towards you from a great distance away. Their grafts are a metallic orange color.
	Jump - Enemies that commit a large leap with high forward force in your direction. Being too close to this enemy as they are airborne
	coverts the jump into a guided attack, scoring a guaranteed hit on you. Their grafts are a metallic red color.

## Game difficulty

There are five total difficulties, and the first four are immediately available for play. Be advised: 

	Enemies gain more Health and deal more damage, up to 100% more Health and 50% more damage at Difficulty 5. 
	You receive more Health and Shield, up to 100% additional Health and Shield at Difficulty 5. 
	Weapons starting from Rarity 2 receive a 20% base damage increase, up to 50% at Rarity 5. 
	Drop rates for Loot and Lucent begin to decrease, receiving a 50% reduction in rate by Difficulty 5.
 
Completing the Campaign for the first time will unlock Difficulty 5 for play. 

## Weapons and RNG

There are seven firearm types available to you:

	-Pistol 
	-Submachine Gun (SMG)
	-Rifles (Single - fires once, Full - fires automatic, Semi - fires three times in succession)
	-Shotgun 
	-Machine Gun 

There are five rarities each firearm can appear with:

	-Usual (Common; Rarity 1)
	-Sought (Uncommon; Rarity 2)
	-Coveted (Rare; Rarity 3)
	-Treasured (Superior/Legendary; Rarity 4)
	-Fated (High-End/Exotic; Rarity 5)

This game's Core system revolves around a Weapon's augmentation through what are known as Cheats. There are two
types:

	Statistical - Cheats that alter a Weapon's performance through manipulating ammo counts, reload speeds and ranges.
	Functional - Cheats that require a condition to be met to receive a particular benefit.
 
	Rarity 1 - Statistical Cheats only
	Rarity 2, 3 - Statistical Cheats + 1 Functional Cheat
	Rarity 4, 5 - Statistical Cheats + 2 Functional Cheats
 
Functional Cheats rolled on Rarity 5 Weapons are significantly more powerful than their standard behaviors. Exotic Weapons, also Rarity 5, 
come with one Functional Cheat unique to that Weapon type, paired with one standard Functional Cheat. 

Thank you for playing. Have fun!
