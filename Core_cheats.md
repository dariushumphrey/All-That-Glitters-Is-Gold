### Statistical Cheats
### Yields
#### Deep Yield
Deep Yield extends the maximum capacity of a Weapon's active magazine by 12%. This percentage is converted to decimal form and then multiplied by a Weapon's maximum magazine size. An integer variable is assigned the operation's result. The Weapon's magazine size maximum is increased by this variable.
